				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project create a live impression of some landscaped image night landscape using procedural generation. The sketch included simple terrain and random star and cloud placement. Inspired by the serene moonlight ocean photo and layered night skies, I decided to focus on visual atmosphere and environmental motion.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
				<p>Color: The layered sky colors were manually adjusted, including deep navy blues, silvery greys, and reflective blacks. The moon is rendered in a soft pale yellow to reflect a gentle night glow.</p>
				<p>Primitives: Stars are drawn using drawStar . Clouds are built from overlapping ellipse.</p>
				<p>Polygons: The terrain is randomized mountain contours formed by chaining curves together. The shape is smooth and gently rolling due to layered random() calls.</p>
				<p>Composition: The moon, stars, clouds, and mountains all respond to a seeded random generator.</p>
				<p>Life: Clouds float slowly from right to left, stars shimmer and the moonâ€™s reflection on the water. Mouse position subtly influences star distribution and drift speed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, the task matched the inspiration image to an acceptable degree. I learned to use lerpColor() instead of hard-coded layers to make gradients both beautiful and reusable.
					However, the starlight effect was not as smooth as expected, and the water reflection glitter system was not up to expectations.</p>
