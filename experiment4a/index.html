				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Offset Brush is an infinite procedural world focused on building dynamic terrain and structures. Players can click or drag the mouse to batch-build rooftops and floor tiles, while the ground continuously fluctuates over time to create a lively environment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>- Implemented a procedurally generated tile-based map.</p>
				<p>- Added mouse click and drag batch-building functionality to activate multiple tiles simultaneously.</p>
				<p>- Introduced a wave effect that makes the ground and buildings rise and fall rhythmically over time.</p>
				<p>- Used seed control (key) to ensure world reproducibility and variation.</p>			
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project helped me understand the basics of procedural generation and interactive systems. Although the initial version felt repetitive, introducing batch-building and dynamic terrain greatly improved the experience. One major challenge was resolving tile overlap issues during construction, which I eventually solved by adding placement detection logic..</p>
