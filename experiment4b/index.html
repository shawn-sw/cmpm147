				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Cube Adventure is a simple borderless mini-adventure game where players control a character using the keyboard, navigate around randomly generated mountains, and reach randomly placed goal points to score.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					- Added a player entity controlled by WASD keys.				</p>
				<p>
					- Used XXH.h32 hash values to generate reproducible and randomized map features (mountains, treasures).
				</p>
				<p>
					- Implemented a goal point system where players gain points upon reaching new randomly placed targets.
				</p>
				<p>
					- Introduced moveDelay timing to regulate movement speed, making gameplay more strategic.
				</p>
				<p>
					- Developed a real-time distance feedback system showing how far the player is from the current target.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This project was the most game-like and involved more complex logic, including movement, collision, and scoring. I gained a deeper understanding of how to integrate procedural world generation with gameplay rhythm and feedback systems. One of the challenges was managing overly fast movement, which I solved by introducing a movement delay, resulting in a much smoother experience.
